    <h2>Information Technology</h2>
    <p>Information technology (IT) is a set of related 
        fields that encompass computer systems, software, 
        programming languages and data and information 
        processing and storage. IT forms part of 
        information and communications technology (ICT). 
        An information technology system (IT system) is 
        generally an information system, a communications 
        system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer 
        system — including all hardware, software, and 
        peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group 
        of IT users, and an IT project usually refers to 
        the commissioning and implementation of an IT system.

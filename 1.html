    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in the mathematical, 
    physical, and social sciences, together with engineering analysis and design 
    principles and methods, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained 
    from systems and processes. Several industrial engineering principles are 
    followed in the manufacturing industry to ensure the effective flow of systems, 
    processes, and operations.

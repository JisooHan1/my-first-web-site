    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>Computer science is the study of computation, 
        information, and automation. Computer 
        science spans theoretical disciplines (such as 
        algorithms, theory of computation, and 
        information theory) to applied disciplines 
        (including the design and implementation of 
        hardware and software). Though more 
        often considered an academic discipline, 
        computer science is closely related to computer 
        programming.
